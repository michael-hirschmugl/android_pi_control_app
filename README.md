# android_pi_control_app
An app for android phones that can control a raspberry pi via ssh.

You can build this project with Android studio and it should run on every version of Android (at least >=7).

All code is in the main file. You just need to specify the IP, user and password for your SSH server (of course it doesn't need to be a raspberry pi).
Right now there are two different functions that can be executed on the remote SSH server. The commands can be specified in the corresponding string variables.

I am not a Java programmer. I am sorry if this code looks awful. It works!
